        Hi! I’m an aspiring software developer, always looking to gain more skills and delve into the depths of the industry. 
        I’m currently a first-year student in Shopify’s Dev Degree program. 
        So I’m studying at York University, getting my Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree, 
        while also interning at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> and gaining lots of experience in hard and soft skills.
      </p>

      <p id="right-info">
        The <a href="https://www.devdegree.ca/">Dev Degree</a> program at Shopify takes on 10-15 students per university as interns, and lets them gain industry experience 
        alongside gaining their undergraduate degree in Computer Science. The program is currently held in partnership with Carleton University
        and York University, the latter of which I attend. Students spend eight months on the training path, and then spend 4 eight-month periods
        interning on 4 different teams.
      </p>

        I participated in DECA, competing in Hospitality Team Decision Making event - becoming a Provincial Champion and qualifying for the

      <p id="left-info">
        I've studied dance for 13 years! This dance style is called <em>Bharatanatyam</em>, and originates from India. I attended 
        Nattiya Kalakshetra Dance School of Fine Arts since I was five years old, and have performed in many programs and events. 
        Although I've completed my studies in dance, I continue to learn on my own and even to compose my own dances.
